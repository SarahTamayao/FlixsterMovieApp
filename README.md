## Flix Part 1

### User Stories
This is first part of a cloned Flixster app movie, where people often search on the app whats trending on the movie theatre and to check which are highly rated movies. This first part of the app I just Got the API and parsed to my project and designed a little UI that you can see the top movies trending. You are able to see the top trending movies with a visual Image and also a little description about the movie.

#### REQUIRED (10pts)

   - [ x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
